Project Description:
The project aims to develop a program that analyzes student grades to provide insights and statistical information.
 The program will utilize Java's features such as data types, if statements, loops, and arrays.

Features:

Data Types:

Utilize appropriate data types to store student names and their corresponding grades.
Use integer or floating-point data types based on the grading system and precision requirements.

If Statements:

Implement if statements to check specific conditions related to student grades.
Determine and display information such as pass/fail status, honor roll eligibility,
 or grade boundaries for different levels (e.g., A, B, C) based on predefined criteria.
Loop:

Utilize loops (e.g., for loop or while loop) to iterate over student grades and perform calculations or statistical analysis.
Calculate the average grade, highest and lowest grades, or identify students with exceptional performance (e.g., highest grade, perfect score).
Array:

Use arrays to store and manage student names and their corresponding grades.
Allow users to input multiple student grades and store them in the array dynamically.
Perform operations on the array, such as searching
for a specific student, sorting grades, or displaying the overall grade distribution.

In this program, the user is prompted to enter the number of students and then
input the names and grades for each student. The program calculates the average grade, finds the highest and lowest grades, and checks if any student qualifies for the honor roll (average grade >= 90). The analysis results are printed at the end.
