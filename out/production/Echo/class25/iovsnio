Java NIO (New I/O):

Buffered: Uses buffers (e.g., ByteBuffer) to read and write data efficiently, reducing the number of system calls.

Channels: Uses channels (e.g., FileChannel) for I/O operations, offering more control and features like file position manipulation.

Non-blocking: Designed for non-blocking I/O operations, allowing you to perform other tasks while waiting for I/O to complete.

Selector: Includes a Selector class for managing multiple channels with a single thread, suitable for handling many connections concurrently.

Performance: More efficient for high-throughput scenarios and concurrent connections, making it suitable for high-performance applications.

Complexity: Can be more complex due to buffers, channels, and selectors, requiring a deeper understanding of these concepts.

Java IO (Input/Output):

Non-Buffered: Uses byte arrays directly for reading and writing data.

Streams: Uses traditional input and output streams (e.g., FileInputStream and FileOutputStream) for I/O operations.

Blocking: Blocking by default, meaning operations pause until complete, potentially impacting responsiveness.

No Selector: Lacks built-in support for selectors, which makes handling multiple connections less efficient without multiple threads.

Performance: Simpler and more straightforward for basic I/O tasks but may be less efficient in high-throughput or concurrent scenarios.

Simplicity: Easier for simple I/O tasks, making it accessible to beginners.
